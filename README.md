# Etch-A-Sketch

The purpose of this project is to develop an online sketch pad with the following
functions:

1. Change cell colour black when mouse hovers over it.
2. Switch the black colour to random colours when the users presses the "Colour" 
button.
3. Switch colouring style to shading rather than solid colour when the user 
presses the "Shade" button.
4. Allow the user to reset the grid colours and cell density through a "Reset" 
button.
